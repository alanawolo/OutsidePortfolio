  <p> I am an Assistant Professor at the University of Michigan School of Information. 
    Before that, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at Microsoft Research New York. I
     received my PhD from the Computer Science Department at University of California, 
     Santa Barbara in December 2012. I received my Bachelors degree from Computer Science Dept.
      @Bilkent University in Turkey in 2007. </br>

      My research interests lie in the area of computational social science; a discipline at 
      the intersection of computer science, statistics, and the social sciences. I am particularly 
      interested in applying large scale data analysis techniques to study problems with social, 
      political, and policy implications.

  </h2>

  <p>
      SI 608 - Networks covers topics in network analysis, from social networks to applications 
      in information networks such as the internet. We introduce basic concepts in network theory, 
      discuss metric and models, use software analysis tools to experiment with a wide variety of 
      real-world network data, and study applications to areas such as information retrieval.
  </p>

  <p>
      SI 618 - Data Manipulation and Analysis aims to help students get 
      started with their own data harvesting, processing, aggregation, and analysis. 
      We cover a wide variety of topics such as using APIs to collect data, SQL, Spark through Python. 
      We use R to perform exploratory data analysis. We use DataCamp for lab assignments for this part 
      of the class so that our students can learn R in an interactive way.

<h2>Prospective Students</h2>
<p>
    Prospective PhD students must first be admitted to UMSI's PhD program before they can work with an 
    individual advisor. If you are interested in working with me, please first apply to our program and 
    then drop me an email. Undergraduate and Masters students who have already been admitted to the 
    University of Michigan and are interested in working on computational social science problems are 
    welcome to contact me. Include your interests, degree, major, and resume in your email.
